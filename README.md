# Take a beer

The web application I propose is a platform for selling barrels of beer to customers. The application is targeted towards craft beer enthusiasts and event planners who are looking to purchase beer in bulk for their parties and events.

The application will allow customers to browse through a wide variety of beer options, including different types of beer and sizes of barrels. Customers can view detailed product information such as alcohol content and flavor profile, and add items to their cart. The frontend will be designed to be fully responsive, allowing customers to browse and purchase products from any device.
